# Arduino-Projects
Useful Arduino projects.

1- Bidirectional Arduino-Bluetooth Communication  
In this project, we are going to make an Android App that will connect with Arduino Nano via the HC-05 Bluetooth module. This app will control the LED, motor, and read the temperature-humidity of the environment. We will use a free MIT App Inventor website for building app via blocks. We will give all the project files for this project. If you are ready let's get started. >> [Project Link](https://trionprojects.org/how-make-android-app-to-connect-arduino-via-bluetooth/)
